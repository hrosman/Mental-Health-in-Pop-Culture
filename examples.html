He also exhibits symptoms of depression, such as an inability to concentrate and a lack of interest in everything. The story is of his attempt to come to terms with growing up. His handling of it is not ideal, as he drinks excessively, runs away from boarding school, famously fantasizes about saving kids from falling off “the cliff at the rye field”, and eventually ends up in a mental institution. He is Hamlet and Peter Pan rolled into one, and has spoken to many people who have interpreted the book in many ways.<br></p>

Later he even went so far as to quote the book at his murder trial, during which he decided to plead guilty, despite more than ten mental health professionals recommending he plead insanity, and was sentenced to life in prison.<br></p>

Mary Harron turned the much praised book into a movie starring Christian Bale in 2000. The film was a financial success and received generally positive reviews, but the graphic use of violence was criticized. Many have argued though, that the nature of the plot makes the gore unavoidable. Bateman is impulsive and obsessive. He is a psychopath in the truest sense of the word and the murders he commits are deeply disturbing.</p>

It is the story of expelled high schooler, Charlie Decker, who kills his teacher and takes his classmates hostage. As his fellow students start identifying with him, he unwittingly turns his class into a sort of psychotherapy group, causing his schoolmates to semi-voluntarily tell embarrassing secrets regarding themselves and each other. Interspersed throughout the story are flashbacks to Charlie's troubled childhood.</p>

These included Jeffrey Lyne Cox who ordered his teacher out of the room and then held his classmates hostage until other students knocked him to the ground and saved themselves without any loss of life; Dustin Pierce who took his algebra class hostage for nine hours after reading the book; Barry Loukaitis who used a rifle and handguns to take his class hostage and then killed three while quoting the book; and Michael Carneal who had a copy of the book in his locker when killed three and wounded five members of a prayer group at his high school. In response, King had the novel stop being printed in 1999, and in 2013 he published an anti-firearms violence essay titled "Guns".

He wounded Reagan, police officer Thomas Delahanty, Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy, and Press Secretary James Brady, who died from complications of his injuries 33 years later. Hinckley had been fixated on Jodie Foster, who who played a child prostitute in Taxi Driver. When she entered Yale University, Hinckley moved to New Haven, Connecticut, to stalk her. He slipped poems and messages under her door, and repeatedly called her. Having failed to develop any meaningful contact with the actress, Hinckley decided to assassinate the president, just as the main character in Taxi Driver attempted to do, to impress her. He trailed President Jimmy Carter for a time, but when Reagan was elected in 1981 he decided to kill him.<br></p>
